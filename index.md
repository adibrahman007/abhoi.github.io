### Biography

<p align="justify">Hello, I am Amlaan Bhoi. I am a graduate student of Computer Science in the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago. My research interests are in computer vision, time-series prediction, data & text mining. I love reading machine learning papers on arxiv-sanity and am always keen on learning something new! I graduated from <a href="http://www.amity.edu/">Amity University</a> with a B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering in 2017 with First Class honors. Outside classwork, my team won the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/lifeguard-io">"Best Microsoft Hack"</a> at <a href="http://hackharvard.io/">HackHarvard 2017</a> (Cambridge, MA) in Oct 2017. I also dwell around with occasional iOS development and Apple's ARKit to develop augmented reality experiences. Feel free to contact me!</p>
